These colors will be applied to UI elements like buttons, tabs, etc. by default.\\n\\n- colorPrimary and colorPrimaryDark are the basic theme colors. colorPrimary is used for most screen elements while colorPrimaryDark is used for darker elements like status bars.\\n\\n- colorAccent provides an accent color for floating action buttons, text selection highlights, etc. \\n\\n- Additional colors like black and white are defined for common colors needed throughout the app.\\n\\n- The colors can then be referenced in XML layouts using @color/name, in code using R.color.name, and in styles/themes to apply colors to views.\\n\\n- Centralizes the color palette so all colors used in the app are consistent and can be easily changed in one place if needed.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a reusable set of colors for consistent theming of the Android app\\u0027s UI.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/layout/bottom_sheet2.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML layout file defines the UI for a bottom sheet dialog fragment.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Sets the root layout to be a ConstraintLayout with match_parent width and height to fill the parent.\\n\\n- Sets behaviors for the bottom sheet like draggable, hideable etc. using BottomSheetBehavior.\\n\\n- Defines a TextView to display text that spans the full width and height of the bottom sheet. \\n\\n- Defines a Button that also spans the full width and height, positioned in the vertical center.\\n\\n- Applies constraints to position the views within the ConstraintLayout parent.\\n\\n- Sets background drawables and colors.\\n\\nSo in summary, it lays out the UI for a basic bottom sheet dialog that can be dragged up/down and dismissed, containing a full screen text view and centered button. This UI can then be inflated and used within a BottomSheetDialogFragment.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/drawable/shape_rect_border.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML file defines a shape drawable resource that can be used as a background for views.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- \\u003cshape\\u003e - Defines the root element as a shape drawable\\n\\n- \\u003cstroke\\u003e - Defines a border/outline for the shape. In this case it is:\\n\\n  - android:width\\u003d\\\&quot;1dp\\\&quot; - Sets the border width to 1dp\\n\\n  - android:color\\u003d\\\&quot;@android:color/darker_gray\\\&quot; - Sets the border color to a darker gray color \\n\\n- This shape drawable defines a simple rectangle with a 1dp border/outline of darker gray color.\\n\\n- It can be used as the background for any View in the layout XML files by setting android:background\\u003d\\\&quot;@drawable/shape_rect_border\\\&quot;\\n\\n- Provides a reusable way to add a consistent border/outline styling to Views without having to define the border properties each time.\\n\\n- The shape drawable is defined in XML for easy modification of border properties like width, color etc in one place if needed.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a reusable rectangular shape with border that can be used as a background for Views.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This file (strings.xml) contains string resources for the Android application.\\n\\nSome key points:\\n\\n- It is located in the res/values folder, which is where string resources are typically defined.\\n\\n- The \\u003cresources\\u003e tag encapsulates the string definitions. \\n\\n- Each \\u003cstring\\u003e tag defines a unique string resource, identified by the \\\&quot;name\\\&quot; attribute.\\n\\n- These string resources can then be referenced elsewhere in the app code using @string/name syntax.\\n\\nThe main functions of this file are:\\n\\n1. Define all text/labels used in the app as reusable string resources.\\n\\n2. Allow strings to be easily changed by modifying this single file, without touching code. \\n\\n3. Support string localization - additional strings.xml files can provide translated strings.\\n\\n4. Prevent hard-coding of strings in code, improving maintenance and localization.\\n\\n5. Provide unique identifiers (name attributes) for each string to reference programmatically.\\n\\nSo in summary, it centralizes all text into reusable resources to make the app translation-ready and simplify string updates.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/drawable/circle_shape.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML file defines a drawable shape resource that creates a circular shape.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- \\u003cshape\\u003e element defines it as a shape drawable resource\\n- android:shape\\u003d\\\&quot;oval\\\&quot; specifies it as an oval/circular shape \\n- \\u003csolid\\u003e element sets the color fill of the shape\\n- android:color sets the hex color code, in this case red (#FF5724)\\n- \\u003csize\\u003e element defines the width and height dimensions of the shape\\n- android:width and android:height set the width and height in dp units, here 5dp x 5dp\\n\\nSo in summary, this drawable shape resource defines a simple red circle/oval shape that is 5dp wide and high. It can then be used as a background, image source etc in Android layouts and views to display a circular graphic element.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_subbanking.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This XML layout file defines the user interface for the SubbankingActivity in the app.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines a ConstraintLayout as the root layout container\\n- Includes a FrameLayout container to hold fragments \\n- Includes a Button widget \\n- Includes a TextView widget\\n- Uses ConstraintLayout properties like layout_width, layout_height, constraints etc to position the views\\n- Sets background drawable for the ConstraintLayout\\n- Defines IDs, text sizes etc for the views\\n\\nIn summary, it lays out the visual structure and positioning of views like buttons, text etc that will be shown on the screen for the SubbankingActivity. When this activity is launched, Android will inflate this layout to build the UI for it. The views defined here can then be accessed and manipulated from the activity class code behind.\&quot;,\&quot;/app/src/main/java/com/example/testproject/CircleView.java\&quot;:\&quot;This CircleView class extends the Android View class and draws multiple circles on the canvas.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- init() - Initializes the Paint object used for drawing\\n- addCircle(int color) - Adds a color to the circleColors list and invalidates the view to trigger a redraw\\n- onDraw(Canvas) - Overrides the onDraw method to draw circles.
